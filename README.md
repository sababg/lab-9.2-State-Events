# Lab 9.2 — State & Events

## Reflections

1: The parent component owns the state. TextInput calls props.onTextChange(newValue). Parent updates textInput. Component re-renders with the new state

2: I estimate it based on Words. My formula is words / 3 / 60. It is based on 180 words per minute, with two decimal places.

3: The Textarea Is Properly Controlled, with the state from the parent that we set as a value for it, and updates the state.

4: I did not know how tocheck reading time, and during the teamwork, I asked about it, and they told me I can use this formula: words/3. And at first, I did not count a new line as a new word, but I later corrected it.
